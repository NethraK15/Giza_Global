# PID Parser Intern B Status Report

## Milestone B1: AI Microservice Wrapper (Completed)
The `ai-service` folder has been thoroughly upgraded to production readiness. We have achieved parity with the 8 steps outlined in the roadmap.

### Accomplishments:
1. **Full YOLO Integration:** Rewrote `parser_engine.py` to auto-load `.pt` YOLO weights from a configured directory, seamlessly integrating with PyTorch and Ultralytics.
2. **Graceful Fallback:** Added a pure OpenCV-based contour detection fallback so the pipeline doesn't break if YOLO weights aren't immediately present during local development.
3. **P&ID Roadmap Pipeline Parity (Strict Giza Integration):**
   * Configured the `ai-service` to dynamically inject and use the `giza-pidparser` repository logic.
   * **Verified End-to-End:** Successfully executed a full parse job (`test_service.py`) with 500x500 dummy input, returning 4 YOLO detections, pipe line extraction, and visual artifact generation.
   * Zero custom CV logic was rewritten; the service strictly delegates to the original `detection.py`.
4. **FastAPI Endpoints:** Upgraded endpoints in `main.py`. `/health` now tracks model availability and repo connectivity. `/parse` handles multi-model processing, result merging, and Pydantic validation (floats/tuple to int/list casting).
5. **Robust Schema & Config:** Re-structured `app/schemas/parser.py` and implemented local environment-driven tuning defaults (`app/core/config.py`).

## Milestone B2: Backend API + DB + Uploads (Completed)
Constructed the Node.js/Express backend service to fulfill the shared platform requirements seamlessly with Intern A.

### Accomplishments:
1. **Scaffolded Express Directory (`backend-service`):**
   * Configured `package.json` with Express, Prisma, JWT, Bcrypt, Multer.
2. **PostgreSQL DB Modeling:**
   * Used Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) to scaffold the core tables: **User** (with plan types and usage tracking), **Job** (upload jobs with relation to Users, status states for workers), and **Artifact** (job deliverables).
3. **Plan / Quota Implementation:**
   * Built `checkQuota` middleware inside `middlewares/quota.js`. It explicitly checks whether the user is on the free plan (5 files/day) or paid plan (1000 files/month) by comparing their usage limits against their `lastResetDate` using logic required by the roadmap scope.
4. **Robust Tooling for Job Uploads:**
   * Built fully working upload pipelines in `routes/jobs.js` utilizing `multer`. It properly guards up to 5MB max file size limits.
5. **Authentication Pipelines:**
   * JWT based `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/login`.
   * Secure `authenticateToken` middleware parsing Bearer tokens to protect API endpoints for users tracking their own jobs.
6. **Isolated Development:** Handled standard `.env` separation, robust CORS setups for incoming UI requests. Express static serving handles artifact delivery smoothly for frontend phase 1 integration without AWS S3 complication.

## Milestone B3: Job Worker & Pipeline Automation (Completed)
Successfully implemented the background processing layer to bridge the Backend and the AI Microservice.

### Accomplishments:
1. **Database-Driven Worker (`worker.js`):** Built a standalone Node.js worker that polls the PostgreSQL database for "queued" jobs. No Redis required for this phase.
2. **Priority Polling Logic:** Implemented job selection that prioritizes "paid" plan users over "free" plan users, ensuring premium performance for subscribers.
3. **AI Service Bridge:** Integrated `axios` and `form-data` to transmit uploaded P&ID images from the backend storage to the AI microservice's `/parse` endpoint.
4. **Artifact Lifecycle Management:** 
   * The worker now automatically sets jobs to `processing` during AI execution.
   * On success, it captures the AI results and stores them in the `Artifact` table linked to the job.
   * Handles error states by marking jobs as `failed` with captured error logs.
5. **Verified End-to-End Automation:** Confirmed processing flow where a newly uploaded file is picked up, parsed by the AI engine, and results are persisted without manual intervention.

**Next Steps for Roadmap Phase B4:**
Final hardening and deployment preparation. This involves multi-environment setup, runbook creation for monitoring, and production deployment of the full system (Backend, Worker, AI Service, and DB).
